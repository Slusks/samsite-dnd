                    <h3>Adventures from the Menagerie Coast!</h3>
                    <p>Our adventure begins on the beautiful shores of Wildemount where the deep emerald stretch of the Menagerie Coast
                         meets the glimmering sapphire of the Lucidian Ocean. The war between the Dwendalian Empire and the Kryn Dynasty seems incredible 
                         distant among the bustling and thriving cities that dot this most western edge of what is quickly becoming a war-torn land. 
                         The life of trade and luxury enjoyed by the varied denizens of this veritable heart of commerce is nearly unchanged, the peace 
                         being kept well by the dependable Zhelezo under the oversight of the Clovis Concord. It appears that the Coast will retain it's 
                         independence and avoid any direct confrontation from the warring nations. Despite this air of hope though, the dark underbelly 
                         is as active as ever, if not more so. Signs of the Myraid and the growing range of their control can be seen in every port, town, 
                         and villiage up and down the shores of the Lucidian Ocean. The Revelry is similarly active, capitalizing on the increased sea trade 
                         caused by the overland strife between the neighboring nations to up their nefarious profits. This is the world our intrepid adventure's 
                         find themselves. In the city of Port Zoon, the center of knowledge and invention for the Clovis Concord, the common folk of the Menagerie 
                         Coast can learn the trades of the many guilds. The most talented apprentices will find themselves calling Port Zoon home as they join their 
                         guild mates in teaching and creating for the betterment of the Concord and the depth of their pockets. Our adventurers have found themselves 
                         drawn to this hub of creation for a multitude of reasons, each as different as the questers themselves.
